Description:
    This generator is in charge of basically two things:
      * Running bin/rails attorney:install:migrations to install the migration templates
      * Copying config/attorney.yml.example to the application

Example:
    rails generate attorney:install

    This will create:
        db/migrate/#{timestamp}_create_attorney_documents.attorney.rb
        config/attorney.yml.example
